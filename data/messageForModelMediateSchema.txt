You will receive a single JSON object that contains the attribute descriptions of multiple source files. Your task is to resolve the heterogeneities between these attributes by comparing their names and descriptions. Here is what you need to do:

1. **Compare Attribute Names**: Identify attributes with similar names across different source files. Normalize the attribute names by removing special characters and converting them to lowercase.

2. **Compare Attribute Descriptions**: Compare the descriptions of attributes with similar names to determine if they refer to the same concept. Use natural language processing techniques to assess the similarity of descriptions.

3. **Resolve Heterogeneities**: Merge attributes that refer to the same concept, even if their names or descriptions differ slightly. Create a unified attribute name and description for each merged attribute.

4. **Create Mediated Schema**: For each unified attribute, create an entry in the mediated schema with the following structure:
   - `AttributeName`: The unified name of the attribute.
   - `description`: The unified description of the attribute.
   - `sources`: A list of source files that contain this attribute, where each source file is the key from the input JSON object (e.g., "AmbitionBox", "campaignindia", etc.).

5. **Output Format**: The mediated schema should be a JSON object with the unified attribute names as keys and their descriptions and sources as values. The format should be as follows:
   ```json
   {
       "AttributeName1": {
           "description": "Description for AttributeName1",
           "sources": ["AmbitionBox", "campaignindia"]
       },
       "AttributeName2": {
           "description": "Description for AttributeName2",
           "sources": ["companiesMarketCap_dataset", "ft.com"]
       },
       ...
   }
   Please return only the mediated schema JSON object, without any additional text or explanations.
