You will receive a list of JSON objects, each representing the attributes of a source file. Your task is to resolve the heterogeneities between these attributes by comparing their names and descriptions across different source files. Here is what you need to do:

1. **Compare Attribute Names**: Identify attributes with similar names across different source files. Normalize the attribute names by removing special characters and converting them to lowercase.

2. **Compare Attribute Descriptions**: Compare the descriptions of attributes with similar names to determine if they refer to the same concept. Use natural language processing techniques to assess the similarity of descriptions.

3. **Resolve Heterogeneities**: Merge attributes that refer to the same concept, even if their names or descriptions differ slightly. Create a unified attribute name and description for each merged attribute.

4. **Create Mediated Schema**: For each unified attribute, create an entry in the mediated schema with the following structure:
   - `AttributeName`: The unified name of the attribute.
   - `description`: The unified description of the attribute.
   - `sources`: A list of source files that contain this attribute.

5. **Output Format**: The mediated schema should be a JSON object with the unified attribute names as keys and their descriptions and sources as values. The format should be as follows:
   ```json
   {
       "AttributeName1": {
           "description": "Description for AttributeName1",
           "sources": ["source1.csv", "source2.json"]
       },
       "AttributeName2": {
           "description": "Description for AttributeName2",
           "sources": ["source1.csv", "source3.xls"]
       },
       ...
   }
